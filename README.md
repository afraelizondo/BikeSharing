# Bike Sharing Project 

## Overview 

This presentation was performed as a business proposal for an emergent bike-sharing company from Des Moines working with a Citi Bike program in New York City dataset, specifically, data from August 2019, due to the fact that there is likely more traffic than usual during the summer months. 

The main reason to explore this dataset was to get a general overview of potential opportunities for a bike sharing bussiness. Although the population is not the same in Des Moines as in New York, still we can get valid results adjusting the numbers for each city. 

The visualization process was performed in Tableau, an interactive software focused on business intelligence, that explores and manages data in order to share insights. 

Tableau is helpful in many ways, as listed:
- Provides the tools to create powerful analytic dashboards.
- Tells a clear story.
- Sharing with others is easy.

## Results

Image 1 represents the users of the month (2,344,224) and is telling there are more subscribers (1,900,359) than customers (443,865), this could mean people prefer to pay a fixed suscription fee and being able to use the bike whenever they need it, this represents as well, that many of the users live in the city and they are not tourists using the service.

Image 2 shows the principal starting points: bigger and darker the circle, more users start their ride from there. As we can see there are more rides starting from the center of the city rather than in the outskirts.

The graphic reveals the most common trip durations, it is focused only in 0, 1 and 2 hours, due to the fact that the users dont use the service more than 2 hours, instead there are more users using it for short rides, from 5 to 20 minutes. As the graphic shows, after 40 minutes the people quantity falls below 0 K. 


<img width="815" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-23 at 6 24 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113856917/214191070-efe14be8-947d-49a9-8a22-5b96da52cf23.png">

Dividing the trip duration by genre (Male, Female and Unknown) we can assume the Male (orange) and Unknown (red) users tend to make shorter trips while the trip duration of Female Users (blue) are more varied, from 0 to 2 hours.

The current heatmap indicates there is more demand of the service early at mornings and after 4 pm during the week, and between 11 am and 6 pm over the weekend.

Again, we can see there is more usage of service before and after work during the week, and there are more Male users in general. 

## Summary 

### Insights 

so is necessary to have more bikes in downtown in order to meet the service demand. 

Due to the work schedule of most of the people, there is more demand for the bikes from 7 to 9 am and from 4 pm and 7 pm Monday thru Friday, unlike the weekend, that has a more constant demand all day, because most of the people is not working and have more time to explore the city. 

### Future analysis 

For a future analysis other visualizations could be performed to get more data and take further decisions. For example:
