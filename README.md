# Bike Sharing Project 

## Overview 

This presentation was performed as a business proposal for an emergent bike-sharing company from Des Moines working with a Citi Bike program in New York City dataset, specifically, data from August 2019, due to the fact that there is likely more traffic than usual during the summer months. 

The main reason to explore this dataset was to get a general overview of potential opportunities for a bike sharing bussiness. Although the population is not the same in Des Moines as in New York, still we can get valid results adjusting the numbers for each city. 

The visualization process was performed in Tableau, an interactive software focused on business intelligence, that explores and manages data in order to share insights. 

Tableau is helpful in many ways, as listed:
- Provides the tools to create powerful analytic dashboards.
- Tells a clear story.
- Sharing with others is easy.
